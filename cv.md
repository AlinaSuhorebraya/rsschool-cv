  My goal is to constantly learn something new and improve my skills, always looking for answers to difficult tasks with pleasure.
  
   Self-development is very important for me. I want to improve my knowledge in web development and achieve success in this direction, create resources that will be useful to many.

   #### Skills:

* languages:
    * JavaScript
    * Java
    * C/C++ at the entry level
* database management system:
    * MySQL
    * PosgreSQL

For example, one event function in JavaScript:

```list.addEventListener('click',e=>{
    if(e.target.classList.contains('delete'))
    {
e.target.parentElement.remove();
    }
} )
```
